It isn't a coincidence that corporate executives seem to always buy and sell at the right times. After all, the CEOs and CFOs of the world have access to every bit of company information you could ever want. However, this doesn't mean individual investors are left in the dark. Insider trading data is out there for all who want to use it. And that's why [TraceInvest.com](https://traceinvest.com) was created.
